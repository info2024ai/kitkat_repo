**Research Idea**

**Title** : AI-driven Personal Assistant Project Integrating Emotional Care and Schedule Management

**Proposal** : In today's fast-paced and competitive environment, people face chronic stress and mental health issues caused by uncertainty about the future. The demand for services that can address both emotional fatigue and the complexity of schedule management is on the rise. This project proposes a personal assistant service that integrates emotional care and schedule management using AI technology. The proposed service allows users to easily keep a diary through voice and photo entries, providing appropriate feedback through emotional analysis. Additionally, AI will recommend personalized locations and assist in managing schedules, ensuring that users feel both supported and organized in their daily lives. This service aims to provide more than just schedule management by offering emotional stability, delivering a comprehensive solution that enhances both emotional well-being and productivity in the busy lives of modern individuals.
